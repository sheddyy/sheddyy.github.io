When the morning bird sings her song, <br>
When the morning sun reveals the beauty of flowers in the spring, <br>
When all is well and all your dreams come true, <br>
When the stars similes at you and the moon shows you favour, <br>
I will stand by you. <br><br>

When the youth finally shade it leaves, as we know it will and a cloud covers your motivation,<br> 
Will you allow me to be your inspiration? <br>
When the rainbow is left with three colours and life finally enters menopause, <br>
I will stand by you. <br><br>

Even if my plans have their own plans. <br>
Even if tomorrow denies me visa. <br> 
Even if am wrong to have been right. <br> 
To this unquestionable fate, I stand as a lamb. <br>
I will stand by you. <br><br>

Everyday is an interview with reality. <br>
And hope that I'm not wasting hope. <br>
For I haven't been on this shore. <br> 
So I'm not even sure if I'm suppose to be sure. <br>  	 	
I can only pray that I'm praying right. <br>
I will stand by Jean. <br><br><br>
